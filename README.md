# Lnkr

**Lnkr** is a link shortening application using the free version of [Bitly API](https://dev.bitly.com/).  

[Lnkr - Live Site](https://bit.ly/LnkrLive)

### Technologies
- React 18 
- Bootstrap 5
- Bitly API

### Features
- `Link` Shortening with open in new tab and copy to clipboard functionality
- `Groups` list and active status
- `Group` detail including: 
    - Name and Group ID `guid`
    - Metrics report of clicks per country
    - `Links` list and summary
- `Link` metrics report of total clicks per 30 days
- `Group` update form to change and save `Group` name  

### Future Improvements 
- The free version of the Bitly API does have several limitations on metrics reporting, additional groups, QR code generation, and short link customization.  Ideally I would like to build these features in with an upgraded account.
- I would like to add a simple back end and user authentication features to allow a more secure and useful application.  As it stands, this is limited by an insecure link to my personal free API account with Bitly.
